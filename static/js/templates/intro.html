<div id="intro">
        Ships that pass in the night and speak each other in passing;<br />
        Only a signal shown and a distant voice in the darkness;<br />
        So on the ocean of life we pass and speak one another,<br />
        Only a look and a voice; then darkness again and a silence.<br />
  <small>&mdash; Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</small>
